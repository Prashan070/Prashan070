I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** at **Coforge** with strong hands-on skills in **Java** and **Spring Boot**. While my current role centers around **Duck Creek** development, 
Iâ€™ve consistently built and sharpened my backend expertise through self-driven projects and continuous learning.

Iâ€™m now focused on backend engineering â€” **designing APIs, working with microservices, and building scalable systems using modern Java technologies**.

ðŸ’¡ Fast learner, problem solver, and passionate about backend technologies.  
ðŸš€ Actively looking for **backend development opportunities** where I can contribute, grow, and build impactful systems.
